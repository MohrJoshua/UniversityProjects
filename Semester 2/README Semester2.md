# UniversityProjects Semester 2

I can not upload most of the projects as the semster is not finished yet. I will update this repository as soon as possible after completion.

## Blockchain programming:

Graded: Not graded yet

In Blockchain programming I 4 assignments in total. The goal was to build our own blockchain. This module introduced the concept of Object oriented programming.

The assignemnts build on each other and I dont want my code to get stolen so the files will be uploaded in september.

## Data science research topics: 

Graded: Not graded yet

For DS reserach topcis I had to choose a topic relevant to data science and do a literature review and write up a report about that topic.

## Final project:

Graded: Not graded yet

The final project is equivalent to a Master Thesis. It will be uploaded after completion.


## Machine learning:

Graded: Not graded yet

I was given a jupyter notebook and had to follow the given instructions. The use of relevant libraries was not allowed and everything had to be programmed from scratch. The task involved cleaning and preparing  and visualizing the data.
In the next steps I had to implement a kNN algorith from  and then perform nested cross validation.
The results were evalutaed and a confusion matrix was plotted. Also some questions had to be anserwed in this project.


## R for data science:

Graded: 52/100

The task was to perform EDA and prepare a dataset of choice for future work/ML. I chose to clean a movie review dataset.

Since I was moving back to germany at the time of this project deadline, I did not spend much time on this project at all and did the bare minimum.
