# UniversityProjects

Those are the first courseworks I had as assignments for my MSc at University of London.

## Statistics and statistical mining:

Product Categorisation using Python 3

We were given a dataset with a description column and level 1,2 and 3 hashes, a "code" for a product. Level 1 being a more broader categorisation , becoming more specific towards level 3.

The task was to preprocess the data and clean it. Then prepare data for TF-IDF and train models for the three levels and save the models.
At last, predict the hashes for each description.


## Data programming in Python:

The task was to find a dataset online, or webscrape data and propose a project which will be worked on as the second part of the coursework.

I webscraped data from transfermarkt.de to get data about the transfers of BVB and FCB in the german bundesliga. The data was afterwards cleaned and processed to perform some EDA.

## NLP: 

The task was to apply NLP techtechniques to a dataset of my choice. I chose the Twitter airline dataset available on Kaggle and trained a classifier to predict, wether a tweet had
negative or positive sentiment about a airline.

## Neural Networks:

The task was to follow the Deep learning for Python workflow for any dataset of my choice. I chose the MNIST Fashion dataset and created several models for correct prediciton of 
label for each imagine. We were not allowed to use more advanced techniques like using con2d layers in this CW. The model achieved 87% accuarcy on the test set.
