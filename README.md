# UniversityProjects

This repositroy is about my assignments for the MSc Data Science at the University of London.

The assesement was usually in form of 2 courseworks(projects) for each module. But some modules hat 1 CW and 1 exam.

The files are seperated by folders Semester 1 and Semester 1.

Grade average after first semester: 78,5 which equals 1,0 in Germany.

Each Folder contains a ReadMe about some brief explanations about the projects.

Modules in Semester 1:

-Big Data

-Data Visualisation

-Data programming in Python

-Natural Language Processing

-Neural Networks

-Statistics and statistical mining


Projects for semester 1 are completly uploaded.

Modules in Semester 2:

-Blockchain programming
-Data science research topics
-Final Project
-Machine learning
-R for data science

Since coursework 1 and courswork 2 for each module are often connected and cw2 builds on cw1, I can not upload a lot of projects for semester 2 at this point in time.
