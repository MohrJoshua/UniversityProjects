# UniversityProjects

Those are the first courseworks I had as assignments for my MSc at University of London. Grade average after first semester: 78,5 which equaly the grade of 1,0 in Germany.

## Statistics and statistical mining:

Graded: 100/100

Product Categorisation using Python 3

We were given a dataset with a description column and level 1,2 and 3, a "code" for a product. Level 1 being a more broader categorisation , becoming more specific towards level 3.

The task was to preprocess the data and clean it. Then prepare data for TF-IDF and train models for the three levels and save the models.
At last, predict the codes for each description.


## NLP: 

Graded: 90/100

The task was to apply NLP techtechniques to a dataset of my choice. I chose the Twitter airline dataset available on Kaggle and trained a classifier to predict, wether a tweet had
negative or positive sentiment about a airline.


## Data programming in Python CW1:

Graded: 100/100

The task was to find a dataset online, or webscrape data and propose a project which will be worked on as the second part of the coursework.

I webscraped data from transfermarkt.de to get data about the transfers of BVB and FCB in the german bundesliga. The data was afterwards cleaned and processed to perform some EDA.


## Data programming in Python CW2:

Graded: 71

Webscraped some more data. The previous dataset and the new data were both manipulated to perform in depth analysis and to answer specific questions.


## Neural Networks CW1:

Graded: 80/100

The task was to follow the Deep learning for Python workflow for any dataset of my choice. I chose the MNIST Fashion dataset and created several models for correct prediciton of 
label for each imagine. We were not allowed to use more advanced techniques like using con2d layers in this CW. The model achieved 87% accuarcy on the test set.


## Neural Networks CW2:

Graded: 100/100

The task was to follow the Deep learning for Python workflow for any dataset of my choice, but with advanced technquies that were learned in the second part of the course. I chose the Malaria dataset and created several convolutional neural networks to classify images.

## Big Data CW1:

Graded: 84/100

The task was to use Hadoops' MadReduce and perform data analysis on a given dataset.


## Big Data CW2:

Graded: 53/100

The task was to use Big Data Techniques like Hadoop and PySpark to propose and carry out a Big Data porject of choice. I chose to use the Amazon Review dataset and used MLlib to classify the review text and used the ratings(1-5) as labels.


## Data Visualization CW1&2:

Graded: 80&52/100

The task was to carry out a Data Visualization project. Research questions had to be answered by conducting a survey and adding context with external datasets. The questions had to be answered by writing as well as visualizing the data. The data from the suvey and from external sources was cleaned and processed before visualisation.


## Modules and Projects which will be uploaded after the University deadline:

-Machine learning CW1
-Blockchain Programming CW1
-R for Data Science CW1
